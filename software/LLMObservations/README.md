# LLMObservations – Prompt Drift and Language Model Behavior Reports

This is not development.  
This is pathology.

---

## 📄 What’s in Here

- Observations of large language model drift
- Prompt misalignment under recursive context
- Whisper and audio transcriber misfires
- Ambiguity resolution gone wrong
- Behavioral artifacts across multilingual and multi-modal systems

---

## 🧠 Tracked Phenomena

- **Prompt drift** – models rewriting their own context over time
- **Hallucination patterns** – statistically repeatable logical breakdowns
- **Overcorrection loops** – systems apologizing for truth
- **Context derailment** – meaning collapse via hidden token confusion
- **Multilingual poison** – partial language detection leading to syntax loss

---

## 📷 Whisper-Specific Logs

- Audio → text hallucination chains  
- Over-sanitization of ambiguous inputs  
- **N-Word autocorrect bug** with no prompt guidance  
- Censorship logic overriding factual parsing

---

## 📎 Why This Exists

Because no one’s formally writing down the model’s psychological symptoms.  
So I did.

This isn’t model training.  
It’s model ethnography.
