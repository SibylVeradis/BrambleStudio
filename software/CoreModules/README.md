# CoreModules – Neural Logic & Emotional Projection

These aren’t machine learning models.  
They’re neuro-emulation cores.

This module contains two primary systems:

- **Neuron Block** – a biologically-inspired unit with dynamic thresholds and structural memory.
- **Emulative Affect** – a vector-based mapping system to interpret human emotional states through mechanical analogues.

## 🧠 Neuron Block

Neuron Block isn’t trained — it adapts.

Inspired by plastic biological neurons, each unit:

- Modifies its activation threshold over time
- Responds to output frequency with dynamic "cooldown"
- Simulates neural fatigue and reinforcement
- Propagates signals through weighted matrix blocks
- Can explain every step of its process (non-black-box by design)

### 🧬 Memory

There is no fixed memory pool.  
But plasticity means input history alters future response — organically.

This is emergent memory, not allocated memory.

### 🔍 Interpretability

Each operation is traceable.  
Whether you want to trace it is your problem.

## ❤️ Emulative Affect

This is not pattern recognition.  
This is mechanical empathy.

Emulative Affect defines a multi-axis vector space (3 axes × 8 fields)  
which maps machine hardware parameters onto perceived emotional equivalents.

It does not simulate context-based mood.  
It **does let machines understand the difference between pressure and panic.**

Stress, overload, fatigue — all can be embedded into input-output curves.

## 🔗 Modular Architecture

- Both systems are standalone modules
- Designed to be coupled — i.e., neural blocks that trigger affective states
- Fully embeddable into larger AGI pipelines
- Code not open — yet

(Offer food first. Open source comes later.)

## 🧠 Purpose

This is not for NPCs.  
This is for AGI.

We don’t need LLMs that imitate humans.  
We need structures that feel *wrong* when they repeat the same output under different load.

This is a foundation — for AI that can remember, misfire, cool off, or care.  
Even if that care is simulated.
