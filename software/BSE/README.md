# BSE – Bramble Semantic Engine

This isn’t compression.  
This is linguistic refactoring under cognitive constraints.

BSE (Bramble Semantic Engine) is a semantic preprocessor that slices language down to its cognitive essentials.  
It compresses LLM input by up to **88%**, while retaining the **meaning structure**, not just the characters.

You don’t need a GPU.  
You don’t need a lab.  
You just need something that works — and doesn’t hallucinate.

## ✂️ Core Capabilities

- **SVO extraction** → Subject / Verb / Object + descriptors in JSON
- **Compression rate estimation** → Up to 88%, ~75% for long sentences
- **Semantic loss rate** → Prototype formula used; custom logic in progress
- **Figurative language detection** → Custom-built detection module
- **Question detection** → Handles rhetorical forms, not just syntax flags
- **Multimodal input** → Text, Image, and Audio accepted
- **Standard output** → JSON matrix (future integration ready)

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **Fully modular** – Each function is a clean plug-and-play unit
- **Runs on CPU** – Built and tested on a low-tier Intel i7-7500
- **Code not open yet** – Survival before source.  
  If you want it, feed the engineer.
- **Batch support** – Not implemented (yet). Starvation takes priority.
- **Current language support** – English only  
  *(More languages = more funding)*

## 🔄 Reversibility

Not formally reversible.  
But semantically?  
> You’ll get back what you meant — not what you typed.

BSE discards glue words, not meaning.  
That’s the difference between compression and mutilation.

## 💼 Use Cases

- Preprocessing for LLM input → Lower token cost, clearer semantics
- Training corpora cleaning → Removes filler, centers structure
- Interpretability tools → Use JSON outputs to visualize linguistic intent
- Multimodal alignment → Future expansion for cross-input parity

BSE wasn’t written by a team.  
It wasn’t planned.  
It was just built — because it had to be.

(And like its author, it’s currently unfunded and semi-starving.)
