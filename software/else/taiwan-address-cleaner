# Step 1: Load raw data and dic codebook
raw_address <- read_csv("Address_Finish_IMNPQ.csv")
dic <- read_csv("dic.csv", locale = locale(encoding = "Big5"))

# Step 2: Clean semicolon duplicates from API returns
raw_address_clean <- raw_address %>%
  mutate(
    Response_Address = sub(";.*", "", Response_Address),
    Response_X = sub(";.*", "", Response_X),
    Response_Y = sub(";.*", "", Response_Y)
  )

# Step 3: Slice administrative fields from Response_Address
address_parts <- raw_address_clean %>%
  select(id, Response_Address, Response_X, Response_Y) %>%
  mutate(
    county = substr(Response_Address, 1, 3),
    Response_Address = substr(Response_Address, 4, nchar(Response_Address)),
    district = sub("^(.*?[鄉鎮市區]).*$", "\\1", Response_Address),
    Response_Address = sub("^(.*?[鄉鎮市區])", "", Response_Address),
    village = sub("^(.{2,3}[村里鄉鎮]里?|.{2,3}里里).*", "\\1", Response_Address),
    Response_Address = sub("^(.{2,3}[村里鄉鎮]里?|.{2,3}里里)", "", Response_Address),
    neighborhood = sub("^(.*?鄰).*", "\\1", Response_Address),
    Response_Address = sub("^(.*?鄰)", "", Response_Address)
  )

# Step 4: Join village_code from dic
address_parts <- address_parts %>%
  left_join(dic, by = c("county", "district", "village"))

# Step 5: Attach results back to raw address
final_df <- raw_address_clean %>%
  left_join(
    address_parts %>%
      select(id, Village = village, Neighborhood = neighborhood, village_id = village_code),
    by = "id"
  )

# Step 6: Output to Excel
write_xlsx(final_df, "final_address_cleaned.xlsx")
