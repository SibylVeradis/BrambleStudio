# Eureka – A Cryptocurrency Backed by Actual Intelligence

This isn’t blockchain hype.  
This is proof-of-work that actually means something.

---

## 🧠 What Is Eureka?

Eureka is a theoretical cryptocurrency system where mining = solving real scientific problems.

> Instead of brute-forcing hashes, miners validate blocks by computing:  
> - Physics simulations  
> - Protein folding  
> - Mathematical proofs  
> - Data modeling

Your reward is directly tied to your contribution to actual knowledge.

## 🧬 How It Works

- **Smart contract ledger** tracks computation request, input, result
- **Problem pool** = curated, validatable scientific/technical challenges
- **Proof-of-compute** = your work must match output expectations or pass peer review
- **Token reward** = issued proportionally to contribution complexity + validation confidence

---

## 📦 Core Design Intent

- Incentivize unused compute to help science, not burn energy
- Turn scientific computation into a parallel economy
- Replace meaningless hash mining with meaningful problem solving
- Support open research via economic decentralization

---

## 🔐 Technical Layer (proposed)

- Compatible with existing Ethereum VM (or similar infrastructure)
- ZK-snarks + deterministic simulation checkers for validation
- API gateway to scientific databases or open-source problem pools
- Reputation system for solver validation and peer-weighting

---

## 🧪 Status

Theoretical architecture complete.  
No implementation.

If you’re a crypto team tired of nonsense — this is your redemption arc.

---

## 📎 Bonus Use Case

- Training AI models through distributed compute  
- Creating public science token economies  
- Funding open source researchers via computation-to-token translation
