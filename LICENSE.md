## 🤝 Collaboration & Licensing Terms

This repository is **not for sale**, but **open to structured licensing agreements** under the following principles:

- 🧠 The creator retains all authorship and core IP rights.
- 💰 No full buyout or exclusive ownership is available — the work is too large, too interlinked, and too alive for that.
- 🔁 Revenue-sharing (royalty-based or usage-tiered) is negotiable per module or application area.
- 👣 Credit and attribution are non-negotiable, under all usage conditions.
- 🧩 Partial module integration for internal tooling, research, or downstream models is licensable under written terms.
