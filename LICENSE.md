These works are not open-source in the traditional sense.  
They are **open for reading, learning, and survival-tier collaboration** under the following conditions:

---

## ❌ What You May NOT Do

## 🤝 Collaboration & Licensing Terms

This repository is **not for sale**, but **licensing agreements are welcome** under these principles:

- 🧠 The author retains all authorship and foundational IP rights.
- 💰 **No full buyout** without creator retention — the work is too broad, modular, and active.
- 🔁 **Revenue-sharing** or use-tiered licensing is possible per module or application domain.
- 🧩 Attribution and visible credit are non-negotiable under all conditions.
- 📦 Co-development (technical or commercial) is encouraged via clear structure.

## 🛠 Example Licensing Scenarios

| Use Case                             | Baseline Terms                                  |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Using BSE in a commercial LLM stack | Revenue share (≥5% of model-layer delta)         |
| Integrating NeuronBlock in SDKs     | Per-seat or per-deployment licensing             |
| AGI module in internal research     | Credit + funding contribution                    |
| Using whitepapers in R&D grant app  | Non-exclusive + author visible attribution       |

## 🔐 Can This Be Bought Out?

Technically yes.  
But you’re not just buying IP — you’re **investing in the creator**.

> If you want exclusive rights to the archive,  
> you must also support the system that creates it.

**Full-archive licensing requires:**

- 📛 Ongoing name retention and authorship rights  
- 🏡 Creator sustenance: housing, workspace, full operational autonomy  
- 🧑‍💻 Creator remains involved (internal or partnered)  
- 💸 Negotiated one-time license fee **+ life-continuity guarantee**

## 🥡 TL;DR

> You want to use it?  
> Feed me first.

If you don’t plan to help me eat,  
don’t plan to profit from my work.
