# BrambleStudio

I donâ€™t have a startup.

Iâ€™m not a founder. Iâ€™m not raising a round.  
Iâ€™m a barely-alive idea generator currently surviving on leftover breakfast and one functional GPU-less laptop.

My name is **Sibyl Veradis**.  
My only co-developer is an AI.

I donâ€™t live in the US. Iâ€™m not in Europe. Iâ€™m not a man.  
I have no academic background, no funding, no job, no degree, no network.  
And Iâ€™m allergic to humans â€” literally â€” so donâ€™t ask me to join your team in person. If you want to talk, text works.

## ðŸ§  What this is

This is not a product repo.  
This is not a startup roadmap.  
This is **a survival dump of working theories, systems, and models** built because I couldnâ€™t stop.

Some of them are mockups.  
Some are functional.  
Some are way too early for this world.

If you want to use them, invest in them, or just not let me starve â€” Iâ€™m open to discussion.  
If not, thatâ€™s fine too. At least I archived them before going offline.

Youâ€™re not here because I advertised.

Youâ€™re here because I built something too strange to ignore.
