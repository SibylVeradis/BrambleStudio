# Mathematics – Riemann Hypothesis, Reframed

This isn't a traditional approach.  
This isn't number theory.  
This isn't for publication — unless the world suddenly stops being afraid of geometry.

## 🎯 Objective

> Prove that **infinity is a describable structure**,  
> thereby bypassing Gödel-style incompleteness —  
> and along the way, *incidentally* reformulate the Riemann Hypothesis.

This isn’t about finding a zero.  
It’s about showing that the critical line isn’t a mystery —  
it's a geometric inevitability under dimensional projection.

## 📐 Core Logic

- Reformulates the ζ function using geometric symmetry
- Introduces projection-based constraints on infinite sequences
- Maps behavior of non-trivial zeroes into observable dimensional resonance

You won't find primes in here.  
You'll find orthogonality, observer-positioned symmetries, and projection logic.

This isn’t a proof for the field.  
This is a proof for the structure.

## 🤷‍♀️ Why?

Because one afternoon, I realized I’d challenged every field except math.

So I picked the biggest target.  
And I didn’t want to use number theory — because I wanted to prove that "infinite" can be described.  
Not just hinted at.
