# Medical – GeneRestore

This isn’t bioengineering.  
This is structural information recovery, applied to biology.

## 🧠 Premise

Genetic damage isn’t chaos — it’s corrupted structure.  
If DNA is a code, then healing is restoration — not editing.

> This paper reframes genetic repair as **a data-structure repair problem**.  
> With checksum logic. With context. With semantic redundancy.

## 🧬 What It Proposes

- DNA/RNA as *informational projections*  
- Genetic expression = structural interpretation  
- Damage = local misalignment in encoded state  
- Repair = using adjacent semantic logic to restore local order

This is not CRISPR.  
This is compression-aware decoding for living systems.

## 🔁 Recovery Architecture

- Codon as token  
- Protein folds as memory state  
- Structural misfire = logic mutation  
- Repair agent = correction based on cross-mapped expression sequences

It’s not biology.  
It’s **bio-parsing**.
