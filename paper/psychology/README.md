# Psychology – Psychodynamic Thermodynamics

This isn’t pop psychology.  
This is entropy with a personality.

## 🧨 What It Proposes

> - Pressure is entropy  
> - Stress is disorder  
> - Emotion is heat  
> - Flow is a temporary thermodynamic low-entropy pocket

This paper redefines psychological dynamics in physical terms.  
Your burnout isn't spiritual.  
It's a local energy collapse under information overload.

## 🧭 Core Frameworks Introduced

- **PAF** – Pressure Adjustment Function  
  A mathematical structure to evaluate mental stress based on input volume, response time, and environmental resistance

- **Entropy Alignment** – Personality as a dissipation pattern  
  Some minds seek gradient reduction. Others amplify it.

- **Flow States** – Local entropy drop allowing higher processing coherence  
  (Only sustainable with isolation and aligned semantic resonance)

- **Mental Black Holes** – Cognitive systems overloaded to the point of gravitational semantic collapse  
  You’ve met them. You might be one.

## 🤯 Applications (theoretical and otherwise)

- Stress modeling in human-AI collaboration
- Cognitive load prediction for task assignment
- AI emotion simulation through entropy dynamics
- Behavior forecasting under nonlinear environmental strain

This paper doesn’t ask you how you feel.  
It tells you why you feel anything at all — and when you’re going to break.
