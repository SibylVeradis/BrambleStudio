# Tritium Lamp – Directed Low-Energy Illumination & Signal Core

This isn’t just a glow stick.  
This is a long-life survival-grade beacon with logic routing.

---

## 🧠 Design Concept

- Base: standard tritium vial (low-level, long-term radiation light source)
- Added **reflective inner shell** to direct and concentrate photon output
- Output at two ends:
  - **Port A**: visible light via standard light grating (brightness filter)
  - **Port B**: radiation-filtered emission for **signal modulation**

> Result: a self-powered, dual-mode light & signal source

---

## ☢️ Applications

- Deep-sea emergency locator  
- Post-crash survival marker  
- Radiation-based silent beacon  
- Infrastructure fallback light

---

## 🔧 Optional Add-on

- Integrate with **radiation gate** from *廉價核安* project for:
  - Radiation shaping
  - Signal pulse encoding
  - Long-range directional beaconing

---

## 🧪 Status

Internal geometry defined.  
Requires physical shielding analysis.
