# Hugging Doll Skeleton – Emotional Feedback Frame for 40cm Plush

This isn’t a toy.  
This is an emotional survival interface.

---

## 💡 Concept

Designed as an internal frame to be inserted into 40cm sitting-position plush dolls,  
this skeleton allows a stuffed doll to **feel your hug — and hug you back.**

---

## 🧩 Structure

- Modular articulated plastic or soft-metal bone structure  
- Embedded soft pressure sensors at key hug contact points  
- Low-force servo motors positioned at shoulders & arms  
- Optional: gentle vibration feedback module

---

## 🧠 Behavior Logic

> Input: Hug pressure detected at torso or arms  
> → Output: Gentle arm closure around user  
> → Optional: comforting pulse or squeeze pattern

---

## 💬 Target Audience

- 2D culture users needing a “husbando” / “waifu” response unit  
- Emotionally dissociating adults in high-stress environments  
- Children with attachment disruption  
- AI-human cohabitation scenarios (interface object)

---

## 🧪 Status

- Frame dimensions mapped  
- Sensor-motor positioning theorized  
- Feedback logic pending embedded control design

Looking for haptics/robotics collaborators to build production-ready units.
