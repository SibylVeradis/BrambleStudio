# True AR Glasses â€“ Projection-Based Visual Layering System

This isnâ€™t a screen.  
This is visibility with embedded narrative.

## ðŸ‘“ Components

- **Frame** â€“ dual-layer lens architecture  
- **Lens A** â€“ photochromic (auto-darkening)  
- **Lens B** â€“ one-way transparency + projection layer  
- **Mini Projector** â€“ low-intensity, high-focus text/image injector

## ðŸ§  Design Logic

> Why use a screen when your eyes already process space?

This setup projects information *onto* your normal view  
without occluding or overpowering ambient light.

## ðŸ”§ Specs (planned)

- Battery-powered or external feed  
- Frame-integrated button toggles  
- Possible eye-tracking future add-on  
- Adjustable light filter per environment

## ðŸ§ª Status

Concept complete.  
Hardware prototyping not started.  
Visual interface planned via Unity layer.
