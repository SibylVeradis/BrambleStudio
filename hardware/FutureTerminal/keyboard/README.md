# Modular Split Keyboard – Designed for Reclined Interfaces

This keyboard isn’t for standing desks.  
It’s for people who never wanted to sit up to begin with.

## 🧩 Design Concept

> What if your arms didn’t have to meet in front of you?  
> What if typing was natural at rest?

This keyboard is:

- Physically split into **left/right halves**
- Connected via **USB male-female bridge**
- Secured with upper/lower locking clips
- Supports **modular I/O nodes** (thumb joystick, scroll caps, NFC ring input)

## 🔧 Specs

- Can be mounted on chair-integrated armrests  
- Each half can operate semi-independently  
- Compatible with:
  - Thumb-based mushroom joysticks  
  - Capacitive swipe plates  
  - Custom buttons (for non-mouse navigation)

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- 🛋️ Made for reclined ergonomic posture  
- 🧠 Removes mouse dependency (keyboard-only nav possible)  
- 🧼 Has built-in wrist wells + sweat-safe surfaces  
- 🧃 Nearby snack access assumed by environmental design
