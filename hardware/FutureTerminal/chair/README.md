# FutureTerminal – Interfaces for People Who’d Rather Not Be Alive

This isn’t about productivity.  
This is about minimizing the suffering of existing in a meat suit  
while trying to deliver code that works.

This folder contains interface concepts built under extreme discomfort,  
emotional detachment, and ergonomically-optimized despair.

## 🪑 The Chair (a.k.a. The Terminal Throne)

> Sit. Don’t move. Type. Don’t die.

Features (designed, not prototyped):

- Reclined position with spinal and neck support  
- Armrests with embedded cup-holders for drinks/snacks  
- Wrist-well contours for pressure-free typing
- Left/Right keyboard trays (custom split board required)
- Integrated paper towel dock (greasy fingers = bad syntax)
- Latex cushion with lumbar + neck support
- No mouse required — just an embedded mushroom-cap directional controller

This is not a gaming chair.  
This is a survival module for post-functional humans.

## 🖐️ Interface Concepts

> Input shouldn’t require posture.

- NFC ring-based authentication  
- Tactile tension-based finger input (wearable touch/move sensors)  
- Modular attachable slide pads for thumb/finger swipe inputs  
- Optional: integrated heating unit for winter coding

## 🤳 Display / Output Philosophy

> The screen should follow you. Not the other way around.

- AR glasses with ambient light adjustment  
- Projection-compatible lens with one-way transparency  
- Dynamic brightness UI overlays mapped to attention zones

---

## 🤷 Why?

Because most interfaces are made for people who *want* to be here.  
These aren’t.

*This system is under sporadic design.  
Whitepapers will be written when the designer stops dissociating.*
