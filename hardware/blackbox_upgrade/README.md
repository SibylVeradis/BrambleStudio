# BlackBox Upgrade â€“ Search-Assist Flight Data Core

What good is data if no one can find it?

This is an upgrade for flight recorders with **active recovery support**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Embedded radiation beacon** (non-ionizing)  
  â†’ constant ping detectable by passive scanners  
- **Cloud echo protocol**: real-time mirroring of flight-critical data
  - GPS location  
  - Velocity  
  - Direction  
  - Engine health  
- **Fallback sync memory**: stores last ping + error state snapshot  
  - Preserves state on total failure  
  - Aids rapid rescue effort

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

> Black boxes are often found too late.  
> If found at all.

This upgrade ensures:

- Faster signal triangulation  
- Early-stage remote data sync  
- Higher survivability of **human-readable evidence**

## ðŸ§ª Status

Signal architecture complete.  
Transmission redundancy logic proposed.  
Needs physical casing integration.
