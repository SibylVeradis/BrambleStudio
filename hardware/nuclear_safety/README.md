# Cheap Nuclear Safety – Low-Cost Radiation Handling Systems

This isn’t lead shielding.  
This is pattern interference and biological scavenging.

---

## ☢️ Overview

Two-module system for low-cost nuclear safety:

1. **Radiation Grating** – for waveform interference-based shielding  
2. **Nucleic Coolant** – for biological-grade radiation absorption & reuse

Designed for: RTG systems, micro-reactors, civilian fallback kits, emergency sites.

## 1️⃣ Radiation Grating – Interference-Based Radiation Dissolution

> Radiation is a wave.  
> And waves can be canceled.

- Microstructure surface engineered to create destructive interference
- Targets gamma and other wave-based radiation paths
- Non-bulk, directional, scalable  
- Works without requiring lead, heavy mass, or active energy input

## 2️⃣ Nucleic Coolant – Bio-Inspired Radiation Absorption Liquid

> DNA and RNA already absorb radiation in your body.  
> Why not let them protect your machines?

- Pure water + nucleic acid = radiation-absorbing fluid
- Radiation tolerance tied to nucleic acid concentration
- Fully recoverable:
  - Filter
  - Enzyme-degrade
  - UV sterilize
  - Recycle

Used for:
- Thermal buffering in irradiated environments  
- Radiation heat scavenging systems  
- Emergency mobile reactor control

## 🧪 Status

- Theory complete  
- Chemical flow logic mapped  
- Physical validation pending
