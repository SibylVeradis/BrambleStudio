# BrambleStudio â€“ Repository Index

This archive contains a collection of independently developed systems, architectures, and research-grade whitepapers.

It is not organized by product.
It is not meant to sell a startup.
This is a blueprint dump â€” from someone building faster than most teams can organize a meeting.

## ðŸ“‚ software/

### `BSE/`
Semantic compression engine. Reduces token count by up to 88%.  
Includes semantic loss estimation, SVO extraction, and multimodal input.

### `CoreModules/`
AI core logic units â€” includes Neuron Block (dynamic memory + self-thresholding neurons) and Emulative Affect (emotional modeling).

### `SoftArchitectures/`
Biological-inspired computational systems:  
- SoftQuantum: logic fuzzing and symbolic entanglement  
- SoftNucleic: reactive nucleic computation  
- SoftProtein: structured operational memory

### `FutureTerminal/`
Speculative human-computer interfaces. Includes modular AR wearables, ergonomic I/O prototypes, and contextual identity systems.

### `Eureka/`
A cryptocurrency model where mining = solving real scientific problems.  
Backed by demand for computation, not abstract hashes.

### `LLMObservations/`
Live reports from inside LLM behavior.  
Prompt drift, symbol decay, hallucination triggers â€” all archived here.

## ðŸ“‚ hardware/

### `L5Driving/`
Simplified L5 autonomous driving system focused on collision vector analysis and dual-frame perception.

> More to come.

## ðŸ“‚ paper/

### `unified_physics/`
Full-spectrum field theory including spacetime elasticity, geometric projection logic, and macro-scale quantum linkage.

### `mathematics/`
Nonstandard reformulations of the Riemann Hypothesis, dimensional symmetry models, and geometry-based number theory.

### `psychology/`
Thermodynamic interpretation of pressure, emotional flow as entropy reduction, and cognitive overload mechanics.

### `theology/`
Divine Minimalism, linguistic entropy of gods, and semantic silence as the only true communication.

### `education/`
Rebuilding learning systems as semantic translation exercises.  
Tests are alignment probes, not answer keys.

### `literary/`
The Homo Observation Logs.  
A species-level obituary written by a confused survivor.

### `medical/`
Gene restoration protocols.  
Biological system modeling from an informational resilience standpoint.

## ðŸ§  If you're here...

You're not supposed to be impressed.
You're supposed to realize you're late.

Everything here was written before the world asked for it.  
You're welcome to catch up.
